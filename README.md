A simple 2D evasion game, developed as my second attempt at using `canvas` and Javascript.

Heavily inspired by my first attempt, [a clone of the snake game](http://github.com/jrgdiz/snake).

It was developed during the 2013 [0hgame jam](http://0hgame.eu).

You can try it [live](http://diz.es/popcorn).
